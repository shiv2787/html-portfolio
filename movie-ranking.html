    <h2> Back to The Future </h2>

If you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style? There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? I've never seen purple underwear before.

There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? No wonder your president has to be an actor.

<h2> The Lord of The Rings</h2>
<p> Movies ipsum Gandalf, my old friend, this will be a night to remember. All’s well that ends better. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. There’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo… and it’s worth fighting for. One ring to rule them all. One ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them! Home is behind, the world ahead, and there are many paths to tread through shadows to the edge of night, until the stars are all alight. He that breaks a thing to find out what it is, has left the path of wisdom.

    Potatoes. Boil ’em, mash ’em, stick ’em in a stew. Gandalf, my old friend, this will be a night to remember. Do you remember the taste of strawberries? I can’t carry it for you, but I can carry you. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. When in doubt, follow your nose. It’s like in the great stories, my Frodo. The ones that really mattered… and sometimes you didn’t want to know the end, because how could the end be happy? But, in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. I thought up an ending for my book: ‘And he lived happily ever after, unto the end of his days.'
    
    One ring to rule them all. One ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them! Your time will come. You will face the same Evil, and you will defeat it. I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. A promise. ‘Don’t you leave him, Samwise Gamgee.’ And I don’t mean to. I don’t mean to. I thought up an ending for my book: ‘And he lived happily ever after, unto the end of his days.' I thought up an ending for my book: ‘And he lived happily ever after, unto the end of his days.' I’m coming, Mr. Frodo. Books ought to have good endings. How would this do? ‘And they all settled down and lived together happily ever after.' That’s no moon. It’s a space station.
